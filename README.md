Steps involved: Data Collection. Data Preprocessing. Exploratory Data Analysis Feature Engineering. Feature Selection. Feature Transformation. Model Building. Model Evaluation. Model Selection. Predictions. Model Deployment. In this project i've selected RandomForestClassifier Algorithm which gives a better accuracy on the data rather than the other models.
